# TempLCD
TempLCD is an Arduino ESP32 project that reads temperature data from a thermistor sensor and displays it on an LCD screen. This project is designed to provide a simple and easy-to-understand example of how to interface a thermistor with an ESP32 microcontroller and display the temperature readings on an LCD display.
