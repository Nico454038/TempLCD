Project Overview
This project aims to emulate old-school video game consoles on a 16x2 LCD display. The LCD display consists of characters made up of 5x8 pixel grids, resulting in a total resolution of 80x16 pixels. This resolution is similar to early video game consoles and handheld games, making it ideal for adapting simple games.

Target Consoles
Game Boy

Original resolution: 160x144 pixels
Adaptation: Simplify game graphics to fit within the 80x16 pixel resolution.
Tiger Electronics Handheld Games

Known for their low-resolution segmented displays.
Adaptation: Convert graphics to a monochrome pixel art style suitable for the 16x2 LCD.
Microvision

Resolution: 16x16 pixels
Adaptation: Games can be directly implemented due to the similar pixel count.
Game Implementation Ideas
Simplify Graphics
Convert the game graphics to a simple monochrome pixel art style that fits within the 80x16 pixel resolution.

Tile-Based Games
Focus on tile-based games like Tetris or Snake, which can be easily adapted to a grid-like structure.

Scrolling Display
Implement horizontal or vertical scrolling to simulate a larger playfield.

Example Game: Snake
Conceptual Outline
Initialize the LCD

Set up the LCD to handle the 5x8 pixel characters.
Display Grid

Use the character positions to display the game grid.
Snake Movement

Implement button controls to move the snake up, down, left, and right.
Collision Detection

Detect collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.
Food Items

Place food items on the grid for the snake to eat and grow.
